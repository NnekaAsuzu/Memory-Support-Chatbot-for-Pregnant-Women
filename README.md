# Memory Support Chatbox for Pregnant Women

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Memory Support Chatbox for Pregnant Women using the GPT-2 language model. The chatbox will provide support and information to pregnant women experiencing cognitive memory issues during pregnancy.

## Dataset

The project uses text data related to pregnancy and memory issues. The dataset includes information about the types of cognitive memory issues reported by pregnant women.

## Methodology

The methodology for developing the Memory Support Chatbox includes:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Cleaning and tokenizing the text data to prepare it for analysis and model training.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizing the types of cognitive memory issues and their frequencies reported by pregnant women.
- **Model Integration:** Integrating the cleaned text data into the GPT-2 model to generate responses for the chatbox.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the chatbox in providing relevant and helpful responses to user queries.

## Results

The Memory Support Chatbox demonstrates the ability to provide supportive and informative responses to pregnant women experiencing cognitive memory issues. The chatbox aims to improve user experience and provide valuable support during pregnancy.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the chatbox could include:

- Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model to improve response accuracy and relevance.
- Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the chatbox's performance and usability.
- Expanding the chatbox's capabilities to provide additional support and information related to pregnancy and memory issues.
