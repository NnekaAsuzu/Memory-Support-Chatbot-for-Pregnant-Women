Remember Liz? These days she seems like a long forgottencomedy act. Instead, Sunak took us even further through the looking-glassinto the Conservative psychodrama. Elsewhere, the picture has been no better. In the US, Donald Trump is now many people’s favourite to become president again. In Ukraine, the war has dragged on with no end in sight. The danger of the rest of the world getting battle fatigue and losing interest all too apparent. Then there is thewar in the Middle East and not forgetting the climate crisis …But a new year brings new hope. There are elections in many countries,including the UK and the US. We have to believe in change. That somethingbetter is possible. The Guardian will continue to cover events from all overthe world and our reporting now feels especially important.

The memory deficits are smaller than the deficits found when comparing healthy 20-year-olds and80-year-olds, but are probably close to the modest deficits found when comparing healthy 20-year-olds with healthy 60-year-olds.' Henry and Peter Rendell, a memory researcher at the Australian CatholicUniversity in Melbourne, reached their conclusion after examining thememory performance of 412 pregnant women, 272 mothers and 386 non-pregnant females. Pregnant women experienced the worst problems inmemory tasks which were more challenging, the authors said in the reportpublished in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology'Regular, well-practised memory tasks are unlikely to be affected, such asremembering phone numbers of friends and family members,' said Henry.'However, the ability to perform more novel memory tasks, such as having toremember new phone numbers or people's names, or recalling five or sixdigits for a short period of time, may be affected.' The authors admit that, while they believe the syndrome definitely exists,they cannot be sure why physiologically it occurs. 'Our own suspicion is thatlifestyle may be a relevant factor to consider; for example the increaseddisruption and dislocation of pregnancy, busyness and the lack of routineassociated with this period,' said Henry. 'Sleep deprivation is also going to bea relevant factor post-pregnancy that could affect cognitive performance.' But some academics have dismissed 'maternal amnesia' as a myth. Dr RosCrawley, who led a team of researchers from Sunderland University in 2003,suggested that negative mood swings were causing the apparent problem, orthat the reason could be 'cultural expectations of impairments which makewomen more aware of forgetting things and attributing such mistakes to their pregnancy'.However, Carole Mitchell, a mother-of-two, who edits a National Childbirth Trust newsletter in Surrey, said: 'My memory began suffering five years agowhen I was pregnant with my first child, Erin. I think that for some women itstarts during your first pregnancy because you're stressed about it and youget bogged down with all the preparations. Then, once you've got a child orchildren, you're bound to forget things because you're always on duty, doingthings and attending to your kids.' John CraceGuardian columnist One-time Monthly Annual CA$5 per month CA$13 per month Other Medical research The Observer Psychology Health Reproduction Memory © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
