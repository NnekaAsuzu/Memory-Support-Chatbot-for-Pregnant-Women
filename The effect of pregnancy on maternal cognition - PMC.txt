This prospective study comprised 40pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women, 20–40years old, native-Hebrew speakers who were recruited fromthe outpatient clinics during a period of nearly 2 years. The patients underwent cognitive and affectiveevaluation. The performance on the three following tests: difficult and total items of Verbal PairedAssociates, the Digit Span—forward and the Naming Objects and Fingers test scores were significantlybetter among non- pregnant women. All the other test results were similar between the two groups,including the depression scores. On multivariate linear regression analysis, after adjusting for age andyears of education , Verbal Paired Associates total score (p=0.04), and Naming Objects and Fingers (p=0.01)remained significantly associated with pregnancy, but not Digit Span (p=0.09). Our studydemonstrates an impairment in memory among pregnant women. Furthermore language skills,particularly naming, were also impaired, a finding which has not been previously described.Subject terms:Neuroscience, Medical research, NeurologyIntroduction Go to:▸Normal pregnancy is characterized by ele5 vated levels of several plasma steroid hormones , which ar4 e Studies based upon animal models reported better spatial learning and memory during pregnancy in rats7,8.Human studies report that hormonal changes affect cognitive performance.

Furthermore the latest literature report structural brain changes during pregnancy and early deficit in cognitive functioning during pregnancy12,15,20,23–28, while others report an improved29 9 concentration decline during pregnancy, while data regarding language abilities are scarce.This study was designed to investigate differences in measures of cognitive function related to attention,memory, and learning. We also aimed to add information regarding language abilities of second and thirdtrimester pregnant women and non-pregnant controls. For this purpose we used a complex structuredcognitive battery including multiple tasks for multiple cognitive functions, in order to detect possiblechanges in other functions as well.Materials and methods Go to:▸This was a prospective cohort study. The study comprised 80 participants recruited from our obstetricoutpatient clinic, and included 40 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women. Inclusion criteria for all thewomen recruited: age between 20 and 40years old and native Hebrew speakers, born and educated inIsrael. The majority were of Jewish origin (there were two Arab Muslim women in the pregnant group andthree in the non-pregnant group). Exclusion criteria included a history of learning and/or attention and/orhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), any psychiatric disorder, brain injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, mentalretardation or dementia, any other neurological disorder known to be accompanied by cognitive decline,and any history or current substance abuse. Pregnant participants were in the second or third trimester.Non-pregnant women came to the obstetric clinic for pre pregnancy consultation and were not recruited ifthey had given birth during the preceding year.The study was approved by the E.Wolfson Institutional Review Board (Reference No. 0216-16 WOMC).All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. All participantssigned an informed consent.Participants were recruited through the physician assistance office between January 2017 and October2018 and underwent the following tests, which were adapted from the ADAS-COG scale. It has beenpr 30 impairment. The results also indicated that demographic variables such as age and education do not play asignificant role in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impaired patients based on the ADAS-Cog scores. In theADAS-Cog scale the items are weighted and have their categories hierarchically ordered. Thus we chose itover other self-reported scales like “questionnaire on demographic, health, and sleep details, the Inventoryof Memory Experiences, and tests of implicit, explicit, and working memory”31.Verbal Paired Associates test: a test of verbal and learning memory. Participants were asked to rememberwords that were paired and read aloud to them, including four easy and four difficult pairings. Weperformed three trials of eight word pairings with scores of one point for every correct answer and zero foran incorrect association. The maximum score for the three trials was 12 for the easy and 12 for the difficultassociations.Digit spanA test of working memory consisting of two trials forwards and two trials backwards. Each consisted ofsix consecutive items in increasing order from three to eight digits. After reading the digits, theparticipants were asked to repeat the sequence. The test was discontinued after failure on two consecutiveials of any item, whether forwards or backwards. We awarded two points if the participant passed bothtrials, one for only one successful trial, and zero if both trials failed. Maximum score: 12.Trailmakingtest(TMT)A test that measures the speed and accuracy of motor response. In part A of this test, the participant wasasked to draw a line connecting 25 numbers in ascending order. Part B required drawing a line to connectalternating numbers and letters in an ascending pattern. The time needed to complete the task wasmeasured. If an error was made, we pointed it out immediately and allowed the participant to correct themistake. The correction of errors was included in the total completion time for the task.WordrecalltaskThis test assesses short-term working memory. Participants were given three chances to recall as manywords as possible from a list of ten words. The words were read aloud each time in a different order(MEM I, MEM II, MEM III). Each word recalled was graded with one point, maximum 10 points for eachtask.WordrecognitiontaskThe test measures the ability to recognize information. The participants were asked to read and remembera list of twelve words. They were then presented together with an other twelve new words and asked whichwords were seen previously. Scoring: one point for each correctly remembered word (maximum 12), andone point for each incorrectly recognized word, also max 12 words.Constructional praxisThis test measures visuospatial abilities. A sequence of four shapes, in an ascending order of difficulty,was presented to the participants who were asked to draw them, in two attempts. Scoring: all four shapesdrawn correctly scored 0, one shape drawn incorrectly scored 1 point, two shapes drawn incorrectly scored2 and so on till 5 which meant no clear shapes drawn.NamingobjectsandfingersParticipants were asked to name twelve real objects that were shown to them and state the name of each ofthe fingers of the dominant hand. Scoring: each object or finger correctly named was graded one point, toa maximum total of 17 points.Ideational praxis (following commands)Women were asked to follow five simple and multi-step directions. Scoring: each correctly executedcommand scored one point. Maximum score: 5.Depression testWomen were given fifteen items taken from the Geriatric Depression Scale as this scale was validated for32young and middle-aged adults as well . The women were asked to rate the items by a “yes/no” response.when answered negatively Scoring: 0–4 no depression, 5–8 mild depression. 9–11 moderate and 12–15severe depression.StatisticalanalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS software v23 (IBM Inc., USA). Normality of distributionwas tested by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. All continuous variables deviated significantly from normaldistribution, except for patient’s age. Comparisons between non-parametric variables were performedusing the Mann–Whitney U-test. Comparisons between patients' age were performed using Student’st-test. Nominal variables were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Allts were considered significant atp<0.05. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed totest the association between the study groups and cognitive subtests, after controlling for confounders.Age and number of years of education were controlled for, as these factors may affect cognitive testsresults. Pregnancy was coded as a dichotomic variable (yes/no). Age and number of years of educationwere coded as continuous variables.Ethical approvalAll procedures involving human participants in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards ofthe E. Wolfson Medical Center research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its lateramendments. Number of Helsinki committee approval 0216-16-WOMC.Informed consentInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.Results Go to:▸Selected demographic and baseline characteristics are presented in Table1. Mean age was similar betweenpregnant and non-pr omen. Mean number of years of education and the rate of smoking werehigher among non-pregnant women. Among pregnant women there were four suffering fromhypothyroidism and two from hypertension and in the nonpregnant there were four with hypothyroidism,one with hypertension, two with asthma, one with lupus erithematosus and one with Crohn's disease. Table1Selected women characteristics according to the study groups.Characteristics Pregnant (n=40) Non-pregnant (n=40) pvalueAge, years 31.9±4.1 31.7±5.2 0.87Gestational age 31.3±6.3Number of years of education 15 (12–20) 17 (12–22) 0.005Smoking 2 (5.0) 10 (25.0) 0.012Medications 8 (20.0) 0.55Diseases 6 (15.0) 9 (22.5) 0.39 Open in a separate windowData are presented as mean±SD, median (range), or n (%).The results of the memory and cognitive tests are presented in Table2.

Our study examined more cognitive tasks than To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report language performance among pregnantwomen. We found a lower performance in the Naming Objects and Fingers test among pregnant comparedto the non-pregnant women. This finding reflects additional involvement of the dominant hemispherespeech areas.The small clinical differences found in the domains of memory and language reflect the change ine performance during pregnancy. Obviously, these diff cognitive changes that occur during pregnancy and resolv eerences do not reflect dementia, but subtley. These milde a fw months after deliverdifferences are not always clinically evident, unless searched for, using specific cognitive tests.Interestingly, this is supported by brain imaging studies that show gray matter changes in pregnantwomen, demonstrating an adaptive behavior to the future role of the mother. In a recent study, brain MRIscans in women before becoming pregnant and again after completion of their first pregnancy, showedchanges in the grwith memor ey matter, and specifically a volume reduction. The hippocampus, which is associatedy, had also shrunk during this period. These changes remained at the end of the 2-year study.39No such changes were observed in the future fathers' brains . The reproduction-related brain plasticity ofpregnant women involves areas implicated in maternal caregiving, reward/motivation, salience/threatdetection, emotional regulation and social cognition, such as the ability to empathize and infer the mentalstate of the baby40.If at first glance, it is surprising that the brain would shrink during pregnancy, causing the so-called"pregnancy fog" characterized by some type of forgetfulness, the answer is logical. We hypothesize thatsince the brain lies in a limited space and closed box, this prior shrinkage is required in order to prepare itfor further development after parturition. The mother-baby bonding requires lots of adaptive changes inthe postpartum mother's brain, which are linked to areas concerned with social cognition, primarily innetworks involved in motivation, somatosensory information and executive functions. These may be thenmediated by experience-dependent plasticity during the postpartum period. We consider the possibilitythat apparent deficits in some cognitive areas during pregnancy and the postpartum period reflect a trade-off; whereby essential cognitive functions that are required by women during the reproductive phase aregiven precedence. This hypothesis is supported by the results of our study as most cognitive functionsexamined did not, in fact, decline. After adjusting for education and age, the attention task reflected by theDigit Span forward test, was similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The performance onattention, working memory, and praxis related items did not decline in pregnant women, highlighting acognitive reorganization of the brain that might suggest enhanced social cognition, including facilitatednonverbal processing of emotions, directed towards establishing a bond between baby and mother24.The strength of our study is related to the multiple cognitive tests used for several domains, in addition tomemory testing. Furthermore, we examined language abilities in pregnant women, a feature that was notpreviously reported.The limitations include a possible selection bias due to a non-randomized recruitment and testing only atone point in time each woman, without taking into account the differences that might appear during arepeated test. An additional limitation is the possibility of an alfa inflation (type I error) by performingmultiple tests.Conclusion Go to:▸Our study demonstrates a significant verbal memory and learning deficit in late pregnancy and a languagedeficit (in naming), which is a novel finding that has not been previously reported.Authorcontributions Go to:▸G.B.and Y.L conceived and designed the trial.
