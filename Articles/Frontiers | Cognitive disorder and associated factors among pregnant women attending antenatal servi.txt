InSub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia, such assessments of a pregnantmother's mental health during antenatal care are uncommon procedures. Instead,there is a greater focus on the physical well-being of the woman and her fetus. Asa result, this study aimed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and related factors in apregnant women attending an antenatal care service.Methods:This hospital-based cross-sectional study included 415 pregnantwomen who were receiving antenatal care at Dilla University Referral Hospital inDilla, Gedeo Zone, Ethiopia. In this study, respondents were chosen usingsystematic random sampling, and study participants were interviewed usingadministered questions to gather pertinent data. This study used the OSLO SocialSupport Scale, the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test,and the Mini-Mental Status Examination to assess the social support, cognitivestatus, and current substance use history of a respondent. Descriptive statisticsincluding frequencies, graphs, and percentages were used to describe the results.A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the connectionbetween independent factors and the outcome variable at a 95 percentconfidence level andp<0.05.Result:Among all respondents who came for antenatal care visits, only 24 (5.8%)were unmarried (single, divorced, widowed). The mean age of respondents was 26years old and 155 (37.3%) had attended secondary school. Variables such as strongsocial support [0.11 (0.03–0.23),p<0.02], being a follower of orthodox religion[0.24(0.12–0.39),p<0.04],≥5,000 Ethiopian birr monthly income [0.28 (0.17–0.48),p<0.02], age >26 years old [1.23 (1.14–2.54),p<0.04], unplannedpregnancy [2.78 (1.45–4.32),p<0.02], and rural residence [3.90 (2.23–7.34),p<0.04]were significantly associated with cognitive impairment at 95% confidenceinterval and ap-value <0.05.Conclusion:This study found that pregnant women who attended antenatal careexperienced a significant reduction in cognitive disorders. Additionally, this studyrevealed adjustable factors such as unwanted pregnancy, social support, andreligiosity. It is preferable to check a pregnant woman's cognitive condition atantenatal services and to follow-up on each additional visit. Introduction The term “cognition” identifies a set of mental functions that are included in the receiving,processing, interpreting, and retrieving of information (1). Cognitive abilities are essential to aperson's entire development because they involve manyof the brain's fundamentalprocesses, including thinking, reading, learning, retaining knowledge, and paying attention.These processes are used to solve problems, recall tasks, and make judgments (2). Globally,the prevalence o om 5.1% to 41%, with a medianof 19.0%,and the incidence of cognitive impairment ranges from 22% to 76.8%, with a median of 53.97per 1,000 person-year (3).The term “pregnancy” is used to describe the time when a fetus develops inside a woman'suterus or womb from the last menstrual cycle to delivery. The average pregnancy lastsroughly 40 weeks, or just over 9 months (4). Worldwide, approximately one-fourth ofadolescent women have become pregnantand in Africa, the percentage of adolescentpregnancy is 18.8%, with 19.3% of reported cases in Sub-Saharan Africa and 21.5% in EasternAfrica (5).Many women go through a period of cognitive shift known as the “pregnancy brain” duringpregnancy and the postpartum period. Mental fogginess and memory issues are thesymptoms that women at these reproductive stages report experiencing the most (6).Additionally, it involves a general lack of emotional stability and self-control as wellas anaggravating loss of declarative memory, which includes forgetting names and importantfaces (7).The prevalence of cognitive impairment among pregnant women has been reported inseveral countries including northern India (23.73±4.69) (8), Indonesia (81%) (9), and Nigeria(58.3%) (10). The contributing factors for cognitive problems during pregnancy are amaternal occupation, a change in thyroid functions (hypothyroxinemia) (11), second andthird-trimester gestational age (12), incomplete pregnancy (13), co-morbidmedicalconditions (14), physical exercise (15), and personality characteristics differences (16). Thehealth of themother and the unbornchild may suffer as a result of cognitive impairmentduring pregnancy, which could lead to an undesirable pregnancy and unhealthy offExperiencing a cognitive disorder while pregnant causes changes to hormones such asspring.cortisol, which have a direct impact on the baby's normal brain development (17). Accordingto imaging studies, a pregnant woman's mental changes are also responsible fora babyhaving an active amygdala in the womb, which is connected to emotional problems likeanxiety and sadness (18). Furthermore, mental instability during pregnancy has an impact ona baby's hippocampal growth and brain chemistry, both of which are crucial for learning andemotional expression (19). Managing cognitive changes during pregnancy requires regulareating habits and physical activity, maintaining stable relationships with friends and family,and abstaining from the use of narcotics and psychoactive substances (20).Despite the importance of the health of a mother and her fetus, there are insufficient studiesdone in East Africa, including Ethiopia. As a consequence, the purpose of this study is todetermine the prevalence of cognitive impairment and its factors among pregnant womenwho would get ANC follow-up service at Dilla University Referral Hospital. This study aims toidentify knowledge gaps, demonstrate the severity of the issue in research areas, assist increating plans and interventions that are appropriate for pregnant women and thecognitively impaired, and provide knowledge to health professionals so they can developefficient strategies. Methods and materials Study areaThe study was conducted at Dilla University Referral Hospital (DURH). DURH has five wards,namely medical (39 beds), surgical (26 beds), obstetrics/gynecology (9 beds), pediatrics (18beds), and psychiatry (12 beds). The hospital has one psychiatry outpatient department, threemedical outpatient departments, one surgical outpatient department, one pediatricoutpatient department, and one antenatal care (ANC) follow-up service. ANC is a maternalhealthcare service provided by skilled healthcare professionals aimed at risk identification,prevention, management of pregnancy-related or concurrent disease, and health educationand health promotion.Study design and periodAn institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 12 to June 30, 2022.Study populationsThis study enrolled all pregnant women who were attending antenatal follow-up at DURH inDilla Town Public Health Institution. All pregnant mothers who came to DURH for an ANCfollow-up visit during the time of the data collection period were the study population.Eligibility criteriaAll pregnant women aged 18 years and above were included in this study, whereasparticipants who were critically ill or had difficulty communicating were excluded from thestudy. Sample size determinationThe sample size was determined using a single population proportion formulaunknown proportion with 95% confidence interval and 5% margin of error. By assuming a(n (Zα/2)2p(1−p)/d2)by an assumption ofp=50%, based on assumptions of10% non-response rate, the total sample size was computed to be (1.96)2×0.5(1–0.5)/(0.5)2=384+38(10%)=422.Sampling procedureAll eligible pregnant women attending at Dilla University were eligible to participate. Asystematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Onaverage, a total of 1,100 participants came for ANC visits in each month. A regular interval (K)was calculated as 1100÷422=2.60–3. Therefore, every 3rd patient from the list ofappointments was selected.Data collection procedures and instrumentsAfter the data was gathered utilizing the interview-administered data collection method, thedata was recorded using the epi-collect software. Socio-demographic data, obstetric andmaternal factors, substance-related factors, clinical issues, social factors, and cognitiveimpairment were all questioned by the data collectors. The information was gathered fromparticipants using a questionnaire that was translated into Amharic and Gedeoffa language.Standard Mini-Mental State Exam (SMMSE–30) is a tool used to assess cognitiveimpairment and includes components for orientation, attention, registration, computation,recall, and language. The administration time is between 10 and 15min. The Mini-MentalState Examination (MMSE) is graded on a scale of 0–30, with 0–9 indicating severe cognitiveimpairment, 10–19 indicating moderate cognitive impairment, 20–24 indicating mildcognitive impairment, and >24 indicating no cognitive impairment. The patient's nativelanguage, educational attainment, and culture are considered when calculating the results ofthe mental status evaluation (25.26.27). A score of 22/30 was deemed to indicate cognitiveimpairment for participants with the educational levels of being unable to read or write andhaving not completed grade 8. Participants with an educational level of grade 9 wereregarded to have cognitive impairment if their scores were less than 24/30. The MMSE had asensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 78%–84%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI, 87%–92%) (17).The Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST-3.0)was usedto evaluate individuals' current use of alcohol, tobacco, chewing khat, and cannabis. It wascreated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify the use of psychoactivesubstances and associated issues in patients receiving primary care. Participants wereclassified as current substance users if they had used any psychoactive substance in the lastthree months (18).The Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS-3)is a quick test of social functioning, regarded as oneof the finest indicators of mental health. It includes several social support fields such acounting a number of helping groups. It measures other closeness, interest, and concern,and assistance in the real day-to-day activities. The OSS-3 results ranged from 3 to 14 on ascale; 3–8 is considered poor, 9–11 indicates moderate support; 12–14 indicates strongsupport (19).MeasurementThe outcome variable (dependent variable) was “cognitive impairment” among pregnantwomen. Thus, the independent variables used for multiple logistic regression analysis wereage, religion, marital status, educational status, number of family members, residence,income, and occupation. Clinical factors in this study were previous history of mental illness,physical and psychological factors, abortion, stillbirth, live birth, neonatal death, pregnancyplanned, total number of pregnancies, gestational age, number of antenatal care visits,current use of khat chewing, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking.Data quality assuranceThe pretest was done on participants with 5% of the sample size in Yirgga Cheffe hospital.Data collectors and supervisors were trained on the data collection tool and samplingtechniques. Supervision was held regularly during the data collection period by both theresearcher and supervisors. Written informed consent was taken from all respondents beforethe actual data collection period. The wholeness and consistency of the data were crosschecked and cleaned manually. Statistical analysis and processingEpi-collect software was used to enter the data, which was then transferred to SPSS version20 for additional analysis and cleaning. The results were presented using frequency,proportion, and descriptive techniques. To identify independently associated factors forcognitive impairment, binary logistic regression was used to determine the associationbetween different factors and the outcome variable, and then all independent variables withap-value of <0.25 were entered in the final model (multivariable logistic regression). Themodel fitness was examined using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. At theappropriate 95% confidence interval, factors with ap-value of 0.05 or lower were statisticallysignificantly associated with cognitive impairment. Results Socio-demographic dataThis study included a respondents with 98% response rate. Among all respondents whocame for antenatal visits, 24 (5.income of the respondents was 58%) were unmarried (single, divorced, widowed). The median,000 Ethiopian birr and 155 (37.3%) had attended secondaryschool. Out of all respondents, 396 (95.4%) were from a rural area and 87 (20.9%) hadgovernment worker husbands (Table1). Global Women's Health Table 1 TfABLE 1.

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressionwww.frontiersin.org analysis of respondents attending antenatal service atDilla University Referral Hospital, Dilla, 2022 (N=415). Discussion Cognitive dysfunction is characterized by deficiencies in motor functioning, linguistic andnonverbal learning, short-term and working memory, visual and auditory processing,problem-solving, and attention (16). According to previous reports, the stress of pregnancyand the influence of hormonal changes during pregnancy may be to blame for reportedcognitive impairment (4). This study found that 112 (27%) of respondents had cognitiveimpairment and variables such as strong social support, orthodox religion follower, unable toread and write, >5,000 Ethiopian birr monthly income, age >26 years old, unplannedpregnancy, and rural residence were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Thisstudy revealed that 27% with 95% CI (22.9%–31.6%) respondents had cognitive impairmentwhich was in line with a study done in northern India, (23.73±4.69) (8). However, this studyfinding was lower than the studies done in Indonesia (81%) (9), and Nigeria (58.3%) (10). Thismight be attributed to the difference in the study setting, socio-demographic characteristics,and nutritional status of respondents. This study also revealed that respondents who wereorthodox religion followers were 0.24 (0.12–0.39),p<0.04) times less likely to developcognitive impairment which is consistent with the results of study completed in Australia(20). Perhaps religious activities such as singing, praying, worshipping, attending sermons,bible reading, and socializing with other believers can maintain abundant neocortical brainsynapses and minimize cognitive impairment.Pregnant women who had an income≥5,000 ETB were 0.28 (0.17–0.48) times less likely tohave cognitive impairment than their referent group. This result finding is consistent with theresults of other research conducted in Ethiopia (21). An increased monthly income can makeit possible for the fulfillment of provisions such as food, shelter, and other necessities thatare vital for cognitive development. This study also found that those respondents with age≥26 years old were 1.23 (1.14–2.54) times more likely to confront cognitive impairment. Thisis also supported by another study done in Ethiopia (22). Effectiveness on mental tasks, suchas tests of processing speed, working memory, and executive cognitive function, which callfor one to quickly analyze or change information in order to make a choice, declines withage (23). This study also found that respondents with unplanned pregnancy status were 2.78(1.45–4.32) times more likely to experience cognitive impairment. Unwanted pregnanciesresult in psychological ill-preparedness, a lack of interest in the pregnancy period, a lack ofmotivation to work, excessive worry about the future, and poor assertiveness, all of whichare linked to the cognitive deficit (24). This study also found that respondents with ruralresidence were 3.90 (2.23–7.34) times more likely to encounter cognitive decline ascompared with their counterparts. This study finding is consistent with a study done thatattributed the impact of living in rural area to a lack of exploring calendars, urbanenvironments, hospitals, and other locations that are necessary for cognitive assessment(25). The final predictor variable associated with cognitive decline was strong social supportandthis study revealed that respondents with strong social support were 0.11 (0.03–0.23)times less likely to have scores associated with cognitive decline as compared with thosewith poor social support. Good social support helps with physical health, food, psychologicalwellbeing, maintaining relationships, practical assistance, emotional support, andconfirmation of values and attitudes (26). Conclusion This study found that nearly one-fourth of respondents had developed cognitive impairmentduring pregnancy. Predictors associated with a higher chance of cognitive impairment werestrong social support, following orthodox religion,≥5,000 Ethiopian birr monthly income,age >26 years old, unplanned pregnancy, and rural residence. In addition, strengtheningsocial support and having a wanted pregnancy is also important good mental state. It iscrucial to assess respondents' cognitive capacities in order to provide better psychologicalantenatal care and to strive to increase social acceptance of their pregnancy. The routineassessment of cognitive function and integrating mental health services with antenatal careservice is vital for the overall wellbeing of a pregnant mother. Data availability statementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article, further inquiriescan be directed to the corresponding author. Ethics statement The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by The researchethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB) of Dilla UniversityCollege of medicine and health science (duirb877/22/06).
