University of British Columbia Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women’s problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women’s memory. Keywords: pregnancy, memory, prospective memory, physical symptoms, mood Deficits in cognition are so frequently reported by pregnant women that terms such as “baby brain” and “maternal amnesia” have been coined to describe their perceived memory loss and absentmindedness. Findings of self-reported cognitive deficits during pregnancy are robust. A recent review found that 50 –80% of pregnant women perceived some degree of cognitive disturbance during pregnancy, with deficits in memory being the most prevalent (Brett & Baxendale, 2001), and a meta-analysis revealed a significant effect of pregnancy on subjective memory (Henry & Rendell, 2007). In contrast to the evidence for pregnancy-related subjective deficits, the results from studies using objective measures are less clear cut. Table 1 provides a summary of the studies using objective tests to assess memory in pregnant women; it shows that for most memory domains null findings are more common than objective deficits. The table also reveals a paucity of

to better understand the subjective and objective deficits in memory associated with pregnancy. Specifically to illuminate the reason(s) for the discrepant findings that have been reported, as well as to explore potential contributors to deficits. We also aimed to increase understanding of pregnant women’s prospective memory functioning. It is possible that the widespread expectation that pregnancy is accompanied by memory deficits may contribute to the greater prevalence of subjective than objective deficits (Crawley, 2002; Crawley, Grant, & Hinshaw, 2008). Expectations about memory failures may lead women to attribute normal everyday slips in memory to their state of pregnancy and therefore to overestimate the frequency of experiencing failures. It is also possible that the difference in findings from subjective and objective measures of memory is not reliable. Brindle, Brown, Brown, Griffith, and Turner (1991) and Sharp, Brindle, Brown, and Turner (1993) have found significant positive correlations between pregnant women’s objective memory test performance and their subjective reports of memory deficits. These correlations raise the possibility that pregnancy-related deficits on objective tests are real (i.e., they are more than a mass-media inspired belief), that pregnant women may be providing accurate reports of their everyday life memory failures. In line with this possibility, the meta-analysis conducted by Henry and Rendell (2007) also showed that pregnancy has a small negative impact on performance of objective memory tests “that place relatively high demands on effortful processing” (p. 798). The implication is that the findings from studies which failed to reveal objective memory deficits may reflect the use of less demanding tests. It may also be that pregnant women experience real 27 CUTTLER, GRAF, PAWLUSKI, AND GALEA Table 1 A Summary

typically free of distraction (Casey, 2000; Crawley, Dennison, & Carter, 2003). Pregnancy is accompanied by a large number of hormonal, psychological, physical, and lifestyle changes which are known to negatively impact memory. One potential candidate to explain deficits in memory is cortisol, a steroid hormone which is known to increase during pregnancy (Allolio et al., 1990) and to adversely affect memory (Seeman, McEwen, Singer, Albert, & Rowe, 1997; Heffelfinger & Newcomer, 2001). Only two previous studies have examined whether hormones account for cognitive deficits associated with pregnancy, and contrary to much speculation about their role, neither of these studies produced supporting evidence (Silber, Almkvist, Garsson, & Uvna¨s-Moberg, 1990; Buckwalter et al., 1999). Depressed mood and anxiety also have a negative impact on memory and have been found to be elevated during pregnancy (Jarrahi-Zadeh, Kane, Van De Castle, Lachenbrunch, & Ewing, 1969; Gross & Pattison, 1994; Keenan, Yaldoo, Stree, Fuerst, & Ginsburg, 1998; Buckwalter, Buckwalter, Bluestein, & Stznczyk, 2001). While there is some evidence that mood disturbances are linked to subjective (Gross & Pattison, 1994; Morris, Toms, East-hope, & Biddulph, 1998) and objective pregnancy-related cognitive deficits (Jarrahi-Zadeh et al., 1969), there is a similar amount of contradictory evidence (Poser, Kassirer, & Peyser, 1986; Keenan et al., 1998; Buckwalter et al., 1999; Vanston & Watson, 2005), making it unclear whether mood disturbances provide a viable explanation for the deficits experienced by these women. The state of pregnancy is also associated with a number of physical symptoms (e.g., nausea, physical discomfort), sleep dis-turbances/fatigue (Jarrahi-Zadeh et al.,1969; Casey, Huntsdale, Angus, & Janes, 1999; Crawley, 2002), and an increased number of novel daily demands (e.g., preparations for the baby’s arrival) which may distract pregnant women and thereby compromise their memory performance. Pregnant women’s sleep patterns have been found to be related to subjective memory deficits (Casey et al., 1999; Janes, Casey, Huntsday, & Angus, 1999; but see Poser, Kassirer, & Peyser, 1986 for an exception) but not objective memory deficits (Casey et al., 1999). The primary objective of the present study was to examine pregnant women’s subjective and objective memory. Our test battery included a number of questionnaires as well as tests of episodic and working memory. Of primary focus, our battery also included a series of tests of prospective memory. In contrast to traditional tests of memory, tests of prospective memory require SPECIAL ISSUE: EVERYDAY LIFE MEMORY DEFICITS IN PREGNANCY self-initiated retrieval of an intention at a specific later moment (Graf & Uttl, 2001), a process that places particularly heavy demands on effortful processing (Craik, 1986), thus making it a likely candidate to reveal pregnancy-related deficits (Henry & Rendell, 2007). We measured prospective memory using both lab tasks, which require execution in the context of the laboratory environment, and field tasks, which require execution in the context of individuals’ everyday lives (Ellis & Cohen, 2008). By this strategy, we were able to examine the possibility that memory tests executed in everyday life, outside of the context of a distraction-free laboratory, may more readily reveal differences between pregnant and nonpregnant women (Casey, 2000; Crawley, Dennison, & Carter, 2003; Rendell & Henry, 2008). Our second objective was to investigate the roles of cortisol, mood, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnant women’s subjective and objective memory deficits. Method Participants and Design Because of concerns with practice effects we used a cross-sectional design. Eighty-five community-living women were recruited through advertisements in doctors’ offices, hospitals, maternity stores, newspapers, and Craigslist (http://vancouver.en.craiglist.ca/). Twenty-four women were not pregnant, 13 were in their first trimester of pregnancy, 24 were in their second trimester, and 24 were in their third trimester. Candidates with neurological conditions or psychiatric diagnoses were screened out before testing. None of the women had given birth in the past year, and most (70.59%) did not have any children. The pregnant and nonpregnant women did not differ in terms of education, t(83) 1.09 p .28, number of children, t(83) 1.06, p .44, or verbal ability, t(83) 1.01, p .32. However, the nonpregnant women were 2.59 years younger than the pregnant women, t(83) 2.14, p .04.1 We conducted this research with the approval of the University of British Columbia Behavioral Ethical Review Board. The study required approximately two hours, and each participant received a $25 honorarium. Procedure and Instruments Participants were tested one at a time in a quiet room. Each was administered several standardized questionnaires and memory tests in a fixed order, and each contributed two samples of saliva. Pregnant women were asked to complete the questionnaires once in a manner to reflect their experiences during their current trimester of pregnancy and an additional time to reflect their experiences before pregnancy. Nonpregnant women were asked to complete the questionnaires during matched time points. These two administrations were counterbalanced. Prospective Memory Questionnaire (PMQ). The PMQ is a standardized inventory assessing prospective memory in everyday life (Hannon, Adams, Harrington, Fries-Dias, & Gibson, 1995). The questionnaire contains four subscales which measure the following: episodic prospective memory (i.e., failures on tasks that need to be performed once after a delay), habitual prospective memory (i.e., failures on tasks that need to be performed routinely), internally-cued prospective memory (i.e., failures on tasks with no salient external cue for prompting retrieval), and use of prospective memory aiding strategies (e.g., reminder notes). Higher scores on the first three subscales indicate a greater frequency of prospective memory failures, and higher scores on the last subscale indicate more frequent use of prospective memory aiding strategies. Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ). The PRMQ is a 16-item standardized inventory (Smith, Della Salla, Logie, & Maylor, 2000), which contains two subscales, one focusing on prospective memory and the other on retrospective memory. Higher scores on each indicate more frequent memory failures. Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). The CFQ is a standardized inventory for assessing the frequency of experiencing everyday cognitive slips (Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, & Parkes, 1982). The questionnaire contains four subscales: Memory, memory for names, distractibility, and blunders. Higher scores on each subscale indicate more problems. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a self-report inventory for measuring depression (Beck, 1987). Pregnancy is associated with a number of symptoms related to depression, which may artificially increase pregnant participants’ depression scores. As such, we removed the seven items pertaining to somatic symptoms (e.g., changes in weight), appetite, and sleep before computing participants’ depression scores. Higher scores indicate greater depressed mood. State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI is a self-report inventory for measuring state and trait anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983). The inventory contains two sections, a state anxiety section which assesses how individuals feel at the moment of completing the inventory, and a trait anxiety section which assesses how individuals generally feel. Higher scores on each section reflect more anxiety. Galea’s Pregnancy Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ). The PSQ is an inventory designed by the fourth author to assess the severity of symptoms associated with pregnancy. The inventory includes items which assess the severity of physical symptoms associated with pregnancy (e.g., headaches, back pain) and items which focus on problems with sleep/fatigue. Higher ratings indicate more physical symptoms and problems with sleep/fatigue. Martin and Park Environmental Demands Inventory (EDI). The EDI is a self-report inventory (Martin & Park, 2002) with two subscales, one for assessing busyness and the other for assessing routine. We focused only on the busyness scores. Higher scores indicate more busyness. North American Adult Reading Test (NAART). For this standardized test of verbal ability (Blair & Spreen, 1989) participants are shown a list of words and are required to read them out loud. The total number of words pronounced incorrectly was recorded. Higher scores are indicative of lower verbal ability. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). We used a slightly modified version of the standardized AVLT (Lezak, 1995) for assessing explicit episodic memory. Participants were asked to 1 To explore the impact of this difference, we carried out a series additional analyses which showed that age does not account for any of the group differences reported below. CUTTLER, GRAF, PAWLUSKI, AND GALEA listen to and immediately recall a list of 20 words, three times in a row (List A – trials 1–3), and then to listen to and immediately recall a new list of 20 words one time (List B). After recall of List B, participants were required to recall the words from List A (List A – short delay). Approximately 10 minutes later, participants were asked to recall the words from List A again (List A – long delay). The number of words correctly recalled on each trial was scored. Picture Recognition Test (PRT). We developed a picture recognition test for the present study. For this test participants were shown 120 pictures of objects (e.g., spoon) one at a time on a computer monitor. Participants were instructed to study the objects for a later recognition test. After a delay of approximately 30 minutes participants were given a recognition test containing 244 objects: 120 from the study list and 124 new objects. The total proportion of correct identifications and response time for correct identifications were recorded. Digit Span Backward Test (DSB). For this standardized test of working memory (Wechsler, 1981) participants hear ever-growing sequences of numbers and repeat/recall each in reverse order. The total number of sequences successfully recalled was recorded. Fruit Prospective Memory Task. This prospective memory task was developed for the present study for the assessment of prospective memory performance in a laboratory environment. Participants were informed that somewhere in the course of the experiment they would see pictures of fruits. They were instructed to stop whatever they are doing and press the ‘p’ key on the computer keyboard whenever they encounter such a picture. There were four pictures of fruit embedded within the recognition portion of the PRT, and participants were given a point for each successful trial. Phone Prospective Memory Task. This naturalistic measure of episodic prospective memory was used to provide a more ecologically valid laboratory-based measure of prospective memory performance (Cuttler & Graf, 2007). Before commencing the neuropsychological tests, we informed participants that we would unplug the phone to prevent any disruptions. Participants were instructed to remind the experimenter to plug the phone back in immediately after being informed the tests were complete. Those who did so were given a score of 1 on the task. Those who failed to remind the experimenter before the debriefing began were given a score of 0 on the task. Call-In Prospective Memory Tasks. As a field measure of episodic prospective memory participants were required to place two phone calls to the lab (Casey et al., 1999; Kvavilashvili & Fisher, 2007). First, participants were asked to call the lab the day before their testing session and leave a message confirming the day and time of their appointment. Second, participants were asked to place another phone call to the lab exactly one week after the in-lab testing session. For each task, those participants who successfully called on the correct day were given a score of 1, while those who failed to place a call on the correct day were given a score of 0. Mail Prospective Memory Task. Inspired by Meacham and Leiman (1982) and Dobbs and Rule (1987), we used a mail-in task as an additional field measure of episodic prospective memory. Before leaving the in-lab testing session participants were given a stamped addressed envelope containing the EDI. They were instructed to complete the inventory and to place it in the mail the next day. Participants whose inventories were postmarked for the next day or one day after the next day were given a score of 1, and those whose postmarks showed late delivery or who completely failed to mail the inventory were given a score of 0. We used this lenient method of scoring so that those who successfully placed the inventory in the mail after the mail collection time would not be scored as failing. Cortisol. Cortisol levels were assessed via two saliva samples. Participants were instructed not to eat or drink anything except water for a minimum of 1 hour before saliva collection to prevent possible contamination with the sample. To collect saliva, participants chewed on a cotton dental roll (Salivette: Sarstedt) for 1 minute. Salivettes were refrigerated at 4–8°C until they were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2500 rpm. Cortisol was measured with a commercially available chemiluminescent technique (IBL-Hamburg) at the Technical University of Dresden (Dresden, Germany). The assay has a sensitivity of 0.16 ng/ml with intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation less than 12%. There were no significant difference in the time of day that nonpregnant and pregnant women’s saliva samples were collected, t(73) .69, p .49. Results Data Preparation All data were checked for recording and transcription errors. Data accuracy was greater than 99%. There were 19 missing scores on the memory tests (i.e., 2% of the test scores), resulting from computer-program failures, experimenter errors, and unreadable postmarks. There were 11 missing cortisol scores attributable to unviable saliva samples. The data from participants with a missing test or cortisol score were excluded from the relevant analysis. There were also 130 missing responses on the questionnaires (i.e., 0.5% of the questionnaire responses). Sixty-six of the missing questionnaire responses came from six participants who failed to return the EDI by mail, and 32 missing responses were contributed by two participants who failed to complete most or all of the trait anxiety section of the STAI. Consequently, these eight participants were eliminated from analyses involving the affected scales. The remaining 32 missing responses were scattered among the participants and questionnaires. To deal with these missing scores we used averages (with an adjusted number of items where necessary) rather than sums to calculate the questionnaire subscale scores. We also examined all of the memory test data and questionnaire data for univariate outliers. We discovered five outliers in the memory test data (i.e., .5% of the memory test data), two outliers in the cortisol data (i.e., 2.5%), and 36 outliers in the questionnaire data (i.e., 1.5% of the questionnaire data). Each outlying score was replaced with the nearest nonoutlying value, specifically, a score either 3or 3 standard deviations away from the corresponding mean. Comparisons of the nonpregnant controls with the three groups of pregnant women (first trimester, second trimester, third trimester) and the combined group of all pregnant women revealed a similar pattern of effects, and for this reason we report only the latter results. Most of our hypotheses were directional (i.e., we SPECIAL ISSUE: EVERYDAY LIFE MEMORY DEFICITS IN PREGNANCY predicted impairments in the pregnant group), and thus most reported effects are based on one-tailed tests. However, we did not predict a direction of effect for women’s subjective ratings of their previous experiences, and thus all analyses of women’s previous experiences are based on two-tailed tests. Do Pregnant Women Exhibit Objective Deficits? The memory test performance of the nonpregnant and pregnant women was compared using a series of 2 and t tests. The results revealed significant, medium-sized pregnancy-related effects only on the mail prospective memory task and on the first call-in prospective memory task (see Table 2). Do Pregnant Women Report Experiencing Deficits? The results of t tests comparing the nonpregnant and pregnant women’s ratings of their previous experiences (i.e., before pregnancy or during matched time points for the nonpregnant controls) with failures in memory and cognition revealed no significant differences. These null results indicate that the pregnant women did not have any preexisting differences or reporting biases. Of greater interest, however, the results of comparisons of the women’s current experiences showed that pregnant women reported experiencing significantly more failures than nonpregnant women on every questionnaire subscale assessing memory and cognition (except for the memory for names subscale of the CFQ), with effects sizes ranging from medium to large (see Table 3). Are Pregnant Women’s Subjective Memory

habitual prospective memory subscale of the PMQ, and also found a significant correlation, r(54) .24, p .04. To determine whether pregnant women’s subjective reports of

of their current experiences revealed that the pregnant women reported significantly higher levels of depressed mood, physical symptoms, and problems with sleep/fatigue. To identify potential mediators of the pregnancy-related objective memory deficits reported above, we computed correlations between those variables that the preceding analyses revealed to be affected by pregnancy (depressed mood, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue) and each of the objective tests that revealed pregnancy-related deficits (the mail prospective memory task and the first of the two call-in tasks). The results revealed significant negative correlations between physical symptoms and success rates on the mail prospective memory task, r(81) .26, p .01, as well as on the first of the two call-in prospective memory tasks, r(81) .27, p .007. Depressed mood and sleep/fatigue were not significantly correlated with performance on either task. To examine the possibility that the pregnancy-related deficits observed on the mail prospective memory task and the first call-in prospective memory task are a function of physical symptoms, we conducted two hierarchical logistic regression analyses. For each of them, we used pregnancy status to predict performance on the field prospective memory task after controlling for physical symptoms. The results showed that pregnancy was no longer a significant predictor of performance on the mail prospective memory task after we controlled for physical symptoms, 2 (1) .76, p .19. In contrast, pregnancy remained a significant predictor of performance on the call-in prospective memory task after controlling for physical symptoms, 2 (1) 4.13, p .02. To seek out possible mediators of the pregnancy-related self-reported deficits we computed correlations between the putative mediating variables shown to be affected by pregnancy (depressed mood, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue) and each of the questionnaire subscales that revealed pregnancy-related deficits. The results, shown in Table 5, revealed a large number of associations between depressed mood, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and self-reported deficits in memory and cognition. To examine whether pregnancy-related self-reported deficits may be secondary to and/or driven by these variables, we conducted a series of ANCOVAs examining the influence of pregnancy on subjective cognition after controlling for depressed mood, physical symptoms, or sleep/fatigue. The results showed that only the pregnancy-related self-reported deficits in episodic and habitual prospective memory were no longer significant after controlling for depressed mood or physical symptoms (see Table 6). Discussion The results from the present study support the view that pregnant women experience everyday life problems in memory, but their impairments are not exhibited in the laboratory environment. Specifically, we found significant pregnancy-related subjective deficits on all questionnaire subscales (with the exception of the memory for names subscale of the CFQ), as well as objective deficits on two of the three field measures of memory. In contrast, none of the objective laboratory measures revealed a pregnancy-related deficit. This pattern of findings suggests that the source of the discrepancy in findings from previous studies using objective and subjective measures may hinge on the predominant use of laboratory measures for assessing objective memory. CUTTLER, GRAF, PAWLUSKI, AND GALEA Table 5 Results of Correlations Between Putative Mediating Variables Shown to be Affected by Pregnancy and

prospective memory (the mail task and the first call-in task), the final field task (the second call-in task) failed to reveal a pregnancy-related deficit. The two call-in tasks required execution of the same plan; however, the first call-in task needed to be performed one day before the in-lab testing session and the second call-in task needed to be performed one week after the in-lab testing session. In addition, the first call-in task had a slightly shorter mean retention interval than the second call-in task (4.5 days vs. 7 days). Overall success rates on the second call-in task were lower than on the first call-in task suggesting that the second call-in task was more difficult and/or that women were less motivated to complete it. The decrease in success rate was particularly dramatic in the nonpregnant controls (see Table 2). It is possible that as the study was less directly relevant to them, the nonpregnant controls felt less invested after the in-lab testing session, reducing our ability to detect a pregnancy-related deficit on this task. Our findings pertaining to prospective memory extend those of Casey et al. (1999), Crawley, Grant, and Hinshaw (2008), and Rendell and Henry (2008). Casey et al. (1999) measured pregnant women’s prospective memory task performance using a single field measure of prospective memory, similar to our second call-in Table 6 prospective memory task. Their results showed a nonsignificant trend for pregnant women to perform worse than nonpregnant women (29% success rate vs. 39% respectively). Crawley, Grant, and Hinshaw (2008) used a laboratory task to assess prospective memory and failed to find any differences in the performance of pregnant and nonpregnant women. Rendell and Henry (2008) examined prospective memory in pregnant women using both a field task and a laboratory task which was developed in an attempt to provide a more ecologically valid laboratory measure of prospective memory. They reported a significant pregnancy-related deficit on the field task, but not on the lab task. In the present study, we used both an ecologically valid lab task (i.e., the phone task) and a relatively artificial lab task (i.e., the fruit task) and failed to detect a pregnancy-related deficit on either task. Our joint failures in identifying pregnancy-related deficits on lab tasks and our successes in finding these deficits on field tasks suggest that it is the environment in which the task requires execution that is important for the detection of pregnancy-related deficits. It appears that pregnant women demonstrate memory deficits in everyday life where they are faced with competing demands, but not in the distraction-free laboratory where their attentional resources

ISSUE: EVERYDAY LIFE MEMORY DEFICITS IN PREGNANCY The pattern of correlations between subjective and objective memory test performance provides further indications that pregnant women give valid reports of their everyday life problems with memory. Pregnant women’s self-reports of the frequency of experiencing prospective memory failures were correlated with their actual performance on each of the five prospective memory tasks, although one correlation fell short of conventional levels of significance. In addition, pregnant women’s reports of memory failures on the CFQ were significantly correlated with their overall performance on the AVLT, and their reports of retrospective memory failures on the PRMQ were significantly correlated with their PRT accuracy scores. In contrast, neither of these subscales was significantly correlated with DSB performance. The failure to detect correlations with this test of working memory is likely because most of the items contained within the subscales do not refer to working memory failures. Future researchers should attempt to correlate scores on self-report subscales that more closely map onto objective measures. Our second objective was to provide insights into the underlying cause(s) of pregnant women’s deficits in memory. As anticipated we found that pregnant women report more physical symptoms than nonpregnant women. Consistent with previous researchers we also found that pregnant women report slight elevations in depressed mood (Jarrahi-Zadeh et al., 1969; Gross & Pattison, 1994; Keenan et al., 1998; Buckwalter et al., 2001) as well as more problems with sleep/fatigue (Jarrahi-Zadeh et al., 1969; Casey et al., 1999; Crawley, 2002). Contrary to previous research, however, we failed to find any evidence that pregnant women have elevations in anxiety (Kane, Harman, Keeler, & Ewing, 1968; Jarrahi-Zadeh et al., 1969; Keenan et al., 1998) or cortisol (Allolio et al., 1990), and we failed to garner any evidence that pregnant women have a busier lifestyle. Our failure to detect a significant difference in levels of busyness is likely because the completion and submission of this questionnaire was a requirement of the mail prospective memory task. Six women did not return the questionnaire at all; five of these women were pregnant. It seems probable that those women who did not complete and return the questionnaire were among the busiest; as such their missing data likely diminished our ability to detect an effect. It is also possible that a different busyness instrument which focuses more on the novel demands in time and attention associated with a major life change would more readily reveal a difference in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Of the potential mediators of the objective pregnancy-related memory deficits, only physical symptoms were associated with worse performance on the tasks. The results of the logistic regression analyses suggest that the pregnancy-related deficit observed on the mail prospective memory task is attributable to physical symptoms. It is possible that pregnant women were distracted by these symptoms or simply less motivated to complete the task because of physical symptoms. This finding may provide additional insights into the discrepancy in previous findings from objective and subjective measures. It is possible that pregnant women who are experiencing aversive physical symptoms avoid or postpone their in-lab testing sessions, while those who attend the sessions are less troubled by physical symptoms, allowing them to focus on the tasks at hand and perform them with relatively little difficulty. The results of the second logistic regression analysis showed, however, that physical symptoms do not hold the power to account for the pregnancy-related deficits on the first call-in prospective memory task, and it remains unclear what factors underlie the pregnancy-related deficit on this task. Future researchers should continue to search for factors which may explain objective pregnancy-related deficits in memory. Given our findings that objective deficits were only exhibited on field tasks, we suggest that researchers attempt to find better ways to measure lifestyle variables likely to be affected by pregnancy. Our findings related to subjective memory suggest that the pregnancy-related effects on the episodic and habitual prospective memory subscales of the PMQ were driven by elevations in depressed mood and physical symptoms. Our finding that depressed mood contributes to some of the subjective but none of the objective deficits in pregnant women’s memory may provide additional insight into the more consistent findings of subjective than objective memory deficits during pregnancy. Conclusions The results of the present study are consistent with the notion that memory deficits associated with pregnancy are difficult to detect using objective laboratory tests which permit women to focus their attention solely on the task at hand in a relatively distraction-free, sterile environment (Casey, 2000; Crawley, Dennison, & Carter, 2003). Our findings indicate that pregnant women demonstrate medium-sized, objectively verifiable memory deficits in everyday life, where they are faced with a number of competing demands and potentially higher levels of aversive physical symptoms. We conclude that the primary source of the discrepancy in findings using subjective and objective measures of memory is an artifact of the predominant use of laboratory, rather than field, measures. The influence of depressed mood on subjective, but not objective, measures may also help to explain the greater prevalence of findings pertaining to subjective rather than objective deficits in pregnant women’s memory. Re´sume´ Des donne´es convergentes indiquent que les femmes
