Nobody really knows.Researchers across the world have begun to chip away at thisperennial question, and the results they’ve gathered so far arestartling: Awoman’s brain, it seems, may change more quickly andmore drastically during pregnancy and the postpartum period thanat any other point in her life — including puberty. And those brainchanges might herald some of the most stereotypically frustratingside effects of giving birth, like that period of forgetfulness duringnew motherhood, otherwise known as “mommy brain,”and themajor mood changes that accompany pregnancy.In 2002, researchers at the Imperial College of London published astudythat involved collecting images of 14 pregnant womens’ brains before and during pregnancy, and a year after they gavebirth. They found that certain areas of women’s brains shrunkduring pregnancy and others expanded again after delivery. But itwas unclear how those changes affected behavior. MOTHERHOODCHANGESUSALL How MotherhoodChangedMy...»Portraitsof SingleMomsby Motherhoodur Bra»DoesMyChild’sNameEraseMyIdentity?»ImpersonatingMotherhood» MothersDont HavetoBe Choice»ThisIsYoinon Martyrs»BecomingaNew MomWith‘OldDepression’»I’mDarker ThanMyDaughter.Here’sWhyItMatters.»WhenYour NameBecomes‘Mom’»In 2016, Elseline Hoekzema, Ph.D., a senior neuroscientist atLeiden University in the Netherlands, published astudyin NatureNeuroscience that built on the 2002 study. Dr. Hoekzema and hercoauthors conducted M.R.I. scans on the brains of 25 firmothers before they got pregnant, and then again in the fst-timeirst fewweeks after they gave birth. They compared these scans to brainimaging from 20 women who had not given birth, and found theywere starkly different from one another. ADVERTISEMENT Middletown NewJersey $950,000$950,000 St MarySaint Mary $379,777$379,777 Malnaco México PRICEUPON REQUESTPRICEUPON REQUEST StAndrewKingston $522,200$522,200 Countries Regions Cities TOURHOMES The women who had recently given birth had such pronouncedbiological changes in their brains that a computer algorithm couldseparate the new mothers from those who had never given birth.In particular, the gray matter in the brains of women who’drecently given birth seemed to be reduced in certain areas, andthose changes stuck around for up to two years after birth.The brain’s gray matter, located mostly in the outer layers, plays alarge role in muscle control and in the execution of high-level taskslike seeing, hearing, processing memories and emotions anddecision making. The brain also contains white matter, whichinsulates the axons, helping brain signals travel further, faster andencouraging motor and sensory function. In Dr. Hoekzema’s study,the white matter of pregnant women’s brains did not appear to bechanged at all by pregnancy and new motherhood, while gray Editors’Picksmatter volume was reduced. ammalsWiththeDr. Hoekzema said that these changes might partially occur MunAnimachlisesWi:Ctuhringbecause of a process known as “synaptic pruning,”a brain Cannabisphenomenon that eliminates certain connections between braincells to encourage the facilitation of new connections. Researchers TaHaruecLk foover.TIshTath?erebelieve that this process could help people focus on specificbehaviors or activities — in this case, taking care of an infant. Inother words, a “loss”of brain material might seem like a bad thing, ‘TECnhuterhbBeuYoussiats Lm’Haveraughsonbut the changes could actually, in part, be beneficial to people faced OwnAlwaysBeenLarry’swith new conditions like parenthood, according to Dr. Hoekzema.Catherine Monk, Ph.D., a professor of medical psychology at theNewYork-Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving MedicalCenter, speculated that this pruning might even be the cause of“mommy brain.”In Dr. Hoekzema’s study, the images showedreductions in gray matter in the hippocampus, which is largelyresponsible for regulating memory. Instead of focusing onrelatively inconsequential tidbits of information, like a movie title,your pregnant or new-mom brain may reallocate resources to theparts of the brain that control “theory of mind,”which allows you tofigure out what someone else wants and needs. Dr. Hoekzema saysthese same areas of the brain also lit up when mothers looked attheir infants, suggesting that synaptic pruning might even promotemother-baby bonding.“I’ve never seen anything like these changes,”Dr. Hoekzema said,comparing her 2016 study to her past research. Importantly, herstudy showed that such brain changes were consistent across allnew moms, even if they had different life experiences.Dr. Hoekzema’s study was also a boon for women’s healthresearchers, especially those who study pregnancy andmotherhood, because it proved what many had hypothesized foryears: Pregnancy and new motherhood are formative for brainfunction.“We’re beginning to see that at this time, during pregnancy and thepostpartum period, the adult brain is at its most plastic,”said JodiPin Fawluski, Ph.D., a research associate at the University of Rennesrance. “Plasticity”refers to the brain’s ability to reorganizeitself.In 2015, Dr. Pawluski published areviewof the available researchon the maternal brain in the journal “Hormones and Behavior,” which determined that while more studies still need to beconducted, focusing on the maternal brain could teach us moreabout behavioral flexibility in all mammals. Dr. Pawluski noted thatthese natural brain changes benefit women throughoutmotherhood, but they may also be advantageous later in life, whenwomen need to take care of their grandchildren or assume othercaretaking roles.Dr. Pawluski’s own research has already started to build on Dr.Hoekzema’s: She found a decrease in the production of newneurons during late pregnancy and the postpartum period in thepart of the brain that governs memory. In her current research, shealso observed an increase in new connections in the brain inpostpartum mice. “I like to think [that] all these brain changes leadto some sort of more efficient behavioral outcomes,”she said.Dr. Hoekzema has also continued her focus on the maternal brain;she’s working to understand more about how gray matter losscorresponds to behaviors specific to motherhood.“Of course these vast brain changes must have a functional impact,but what functions are indeed altered by these brain changes?”Dr.Hoekzema said. “And how do these relate to maladaptive changessuch as the development of postpartum depression?”Dr. Simone Vigod, M.D., a women’s health psychiatrist and chief ofthe department of psychiatry at Women’s College Hospital inToronto, is also working on mapping the maternal brain. She saidpregnant women and new mothers are difficult to recruit forstudies, because of busy schedules and safety restrictions. Fundingfor women’s health research can also be tough to come by. Butdespite these challenges, Dr. Vigod is looking at ways to treat mooddisorders during pregnancy without medication. Her hunch is thatsynaptic pruning and brain reorganization might be linked in someway to the sion and anxietesdeprduring the postpartum period.ythat women can experience And while much more research is needed, there’s even emergingevidence to suggest that brain changes during new parenthoodmight not be specific to just mothers.Fathers— and evenpotentiallyadoptive parents,nurses in the NICU, nannies andgrandparents — might experience shifts in brain function to makethem more effective guardians once they begin caring for a child,said Helena Rutherford, Ph.D., a researcher at the Child StudyCenter at the Yale School of Medicine.“To move forward, we need people to acknowledge the value andimportance of the transition to parenthood,”Dr. Pawluski said,recalling her own experience with forgetfulness during pregnancy.The experience was unsettling, she said, and it reminded her thateducating parents on the potential reasons for these deficits can beincredibly affirming during a challenging time.The birth of a child affects parents in a phenomenal way, she said.“If I can give knowledge to other people about that, I think I’mdoing my job.” JenniGrittersisafreelancejournalistbasedinSeattle.Shecovershealth,psychologyandtravel. HowMen’sBodiesChangeWhenTheyBecomeFathersApril15,2020 PostpartumBodyChangesYouShouldKnowAbout READ 4 COMMENTS PSharefullarticle regnancy,Childbirt4 handPostpartumExperiences DepressionandSuicide:Womenwhoexperiencedepressionduringpregnancyorintheyearaftergivingbirthhaveagreaterriskofsuicideandattemptedsuicide.ALongAwaitedBreakthrough:Scientistssaidtheyhadpinpointedthecauseofseveremorningsickness—adiscoverycouldleadtobetter treatments for severenauseaandvomitingduringpregnancy.CuttingBabies’Tongues:Dentistsandlactationconsultantsarepushing“tonguetiereleases”onnewmothersstrugglingtobreastfeed.Here’swhat to know.FailingBlackFamilies:ManypregnantBlackwomenreportfeelingignoredordismissedbydoctors.Thoseexperiencescanhavedeadlyconsequencesfor themandtheirbabies.APillforPostpartumDepression:The F.D.A. hasapprovedthefirstpillforpostpartumdepression,amilestoneconsideredlikelytoincreaserecognitionandtreatment of thedebilitatingcondition.TheMostDangerousTime:Researchshowsthatmostpregnancy-relatedmaternaldeathsoccurintheyearafterababyisborn.Thediscoveryischanginghow doctors care for new mothers. MoreInParenting TrendinginTheTimes 12WaystoSaveonFamilyTravelJingWei TheSuperBowlAds,RankedhiefWitnessAgainstGaetzIsCooperatingWithHouseEthicsInvestigation TheStealthCampaignThat’s usmrevaence ses gan, TheyBargainedForKim RaffforTheNewYork Times AtiPl RiAiJacquelineDormer/Republican-Herald viaAssociatedPress, SeekingaFamily,TheyGotMoreThanGettingYourKidsHookedon StudyFinds Seein th W ldTh hKiduTgheNewYork Timesge or ros sas oungas re ng oern as re marrasng.Eyes SocialMediaMoreThanEver, WhichJustMightBeGood RomeFinallyGetstheModernHotelsIt CKid Y 8A UsiDmitryKostyukovforTheNewYork Times hess Md DdAEb siPhotoillustrationbyMark Harris WinterStormCouldBringUptoaFootofSnowtoPartsoftheNortheastIBMReopensItsFrozenPensionPlan,SavingtheCompanyMillions2JetBluePlanesCollideonTarmacatLoganAirportinBoston StudyFinds Politics. Deserves Editors’Picks AnOld-SchoolRingBecomesaModernStyleSignifierFiveInternationalMoviestoStreamNowBoyIsCriticallyWoundedinShootingatHoustonChurchLedbyJoelOsteen AMildC iti Im i tenVartikaSharmaognve parmAt116ShHOtliedAleexanadrsaHootunicvk forTheNewYork Times,TiF dAPehlTyNBC/oNBC vieraAssrociatedPressnaeyan m, yDiagnosisCanBeScary.Here’s GenerationsofLovedOnes.But Stand-UpfortheFirstTimeWhatComesNext.
